The risk index is a method used to combine risk information from clinical and genetic factors in order to make a qualitative (i.e., "high risk" or "low risk") prediction about an individual's risk of developing a particular disease. THis project was created as the basis for a dissertation project by [Reagan Kelly](http://www.reagank.com), a Ph.D. student in [Bioinformatics](http://www.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu) at the [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu)
